# Machine Learning portfolio
My personal portfolio of Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

I mainly feed my portfolio by solving popular kaggle [challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

In addition, I might add my solutions to Machine Learning and Data Science homeworks from popular courses.

I mainly use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) frameworks, programming in Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. I am also familiar with MATLAB's [Deep Learning toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning) and [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats).
