# Machine Learning portfolio
My personal portfolio of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science projects.

I mainly feed my portfolio by solving popular kaggle [challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

In addition, I might add my solutions to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science assignments and final projects from popular courses.

I mainly use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) frameworks, programming in Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. I am also familiar with MATLAB's [Deep Learning toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning) and [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats).

## Current content of this repo:
1. My [solution](https://github.com/lmiguelgato/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/credit-card-fraud-detection) to a [Kaggle's challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud): identify fraudulent credit card transactions, from a dataset containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. The accuracy of my solution is around 98 % in a balanced dataset of unseen credit card transactions.

2. My [solution](https://github.com/lmiguelgato/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/deep-learning-final-project) to the final assignment of the "[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)" course from the Deep Learning Specialization program by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).
* [Part 1](https://github.com/lmiguelgato/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/deep-learning-final-project/Building_a_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb): Building a deep neural network step by step, with as many layers as desired.
* [Part 2](https://github.com/lmiguelgato/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/deep-learning-final-project/Deep_Neural_Network_Application.ipynb): Deep neural network for image classification. Apply our deep network to cat vs non-cat classification.
